# Adventure-booking-site

This website is built using Tailwind CSS, HTML, and a small amount of JavaScript. In the future, I plan to implement Firebase to save user data and create a scheduling booking system. This website is designed to provide you with ideas for similar projects. Thank you. 

## Installation

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/AnubhavSC/Adventure-booking-site
  cd Adventure-booking-site

  npx tailwindcss -i ./css/input.css -o ./css/output.css --watch 
```
